# QuickCard - HackOhio 2020 - Group Clickbait
This is the repository for our HackOhio 2020 project, which won third place. Our team, Clickbait, is composed of Miami students Keith Meyer, Rebecca Gruenberg, and Kyle Lochtefeld, along with Sinclair student George Bolmida. While our webapp is no longer available, you can still peruse our codebase.

## Description
In an increasingly digital age, the need for online tools and rich digital learning environments is important. Our project called QuickCard is an engaging study tool for the modern student. Students can upload the syllabus from their class and using OCR technology we can pull the important words right off the page and into a generated study quiz. Users can customize the results of their generated quiz to their liking as well as make use of our highlighting tool, through which users can upload PDFs, highlight the important topics, and automatically create notes and notecards as they go. 

Our site was previously hosted at http://hackohio-teamclickbait.fish, but is disabled since the conclusion of the competition.
